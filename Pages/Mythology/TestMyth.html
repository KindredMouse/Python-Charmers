            <p class = "Myth-Text">Osiris, a wise and kind god, ruled Egypt and taught his people how to live peacefully. 
                                   His jealous brother Seth plotted to kill him by tricking him into lying in a beautiful 
                                   chest made to fit him perfectly. Seth sealed the chest and threw it into the Nile River.
                                   Osiris’s wife, Isis, found his body, but Seth also discovered it, cut it into fourteen pieces,
                                   and scattered them across Egypt. With the help of Nephthys, Thoth, and Anubis, Isis gathered
                                   the pieces, reassembled Osiris, and used magic to bring him back to life.

                                   Osiris then became king of the Afterlife, while Isis later gave birth to their son, Horus. 
                                   When grown, Horus fought Seth to avenge his father and lost an eye that was magically restored,
                                    becoming the symbol known as the Eye of Horus. In the end, Horus defeated Seth, reclaimed the
                                     throne, and restored peace and order to Egypt.

   <h3>The Battles of Horus and Set</h3>
   <div class="Myth-Body">
        <div class = "myth-text-holder">
            <p class = "Myth-Text">After Osiris was slain by his jealous brother Set, Horus, the son of Osiris and Isis, vowed to avenge
                                   his father and reclaim the throne of Egypt. The gods gathered to judge between them, and Ra himself 
                                   presided over the court. For eighty years, Horus and Set clashed in contests of strength, wit, and endurance. 
                                   They turned into hippopotamuses and battled beneath the Nile, each trying to drown the other. Set once tore out 
                                   Horus's eyes, but Isis restored them with her magic. In return, Horus captured Set and brought him bound before 
                                   the divine court, though Isis showed mercy and released him, enraging her son.

                                   Their struggle continued with trickery and humiliation—Set tried to prove dominance through deception, but Horus
                                    exposed his schemes before the gods. Tired of the endless quarrel, the gods summoned Osiris from the underworld
                                    to give judgment. Osiris declared that his son was the rightful ruler and that justice demanded his coronation. 
                                    Set was defeated and sent to dwell in the deserts, ruling over storms and chaos, while Horus took his father's 
                                    throne and brought peace to Egypt. reference - "thegreatcultures.com"</p>

            <p class = "Myth-Text">Each night, as the sun set over Egypt, the sun god Ra begins his perilous journey through the Duat, the Egyptian underworld.
                                 He sailes in his solar barque, carrying the light of the sun through the realm of darkness. Alongside him are gods 
                                 like Set, who defends the boat, and Thoth, who records events. As Ra travels, he passed through twelve gates, each 
                                 representing an hour of the night and guarded by fearsome spirits. In these shadowy realms, the souls of the dead await 
                                 judgment, and the gods of the afterlife perform sacred rituals to ensure balance.
                                <br><br>
                                The greatest danger comes from Apophis (Apep), a giant serpent of chaos who tries to swallow the sun and plunge the world 
                                into eternal night. Every night, Ra and his companions battle Apophis in a fierce struggle between order (ma'at) and chaos
                                (isfet). When Ra triumphs, he is reborn as the morning sun, emerging once again in the east to bring light and life to the
                                 world. His journey is symbolic for the cycle of death, rebirth, and renewal. reference - "worldhistoryedu.com"</p>
