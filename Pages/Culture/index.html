<h3>Religion</h3>
<div>
<p>
Today, the majority of Egyptians practice Islam, while a smaller portion of the population follows Christianity, primarily the Coptic Orthodox Church. 
Religion has always been central to Egyptian life. In ancient times, Egyptians worshiped a rich pantheon of gods and goddesses, including Ra, the sun god; Isis, the goddess of magic and motherhood; and Anubis, the guardian of the afterlife. 
Temples, pyramids, and elaborate tombs were constructed to honor these deities, reflecting the deep spiritual beliefs that shaped society. 
Religious practices influenced daily routines, governance, art, and architecture, leaving a legacy that still inspires and fascinates people around the world today.
