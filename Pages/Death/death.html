                <div>
                    <p>In ancient Egypt, burial practices were deeply rooted in the belief 
                        that life continued after death in a realm mirroring one’s earthly existence. 
                        The deceased needed their physical body preserved and intact so that their 
                        spiritual essence—comprising components such as the ka (life-force) and ba 
                        (personality)—could recognize it and thus secure access to the afterlife. 
                        Because of this belief, elaborate mummification and the inclusion of grave 
                        goods—such as food, furniture, amulets, and everyday items—were standard, 
                        especially among the wealthy. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>A pivotal part of the funeral process was the “Opening of the Mouth” ritual, 
                        during which priests used ceremonial tools to touch the mummy’s mouth, eyes, 
                        and limbs in order to symbolically restore the senses and functions needed in 
                        the afterlife. Depending on one’s social status, the burial might be a simple 
                        grave with minimal goods—or, for a pharaoh or high official, a grand tomb richly 
                        furnished and sealed for eternity. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Tombs themselves evolved over millennia—from simple oval graves in the Predynastic 
                        period to elaborate underground chambers and pyramids for rulers—and always maintained 
                        the purpose of protecting the body and preserving the soul’s journey. The offerings and 
                        rituals performed were not just for mourning: they were for enabling the deceased’s successful 
                        transition into a blissful afterlife, often depicted as the “Field of Reeds,” an ideal version 
                        of Egypt where the deceased could live on eternally.

                <div>
                    <p>The ancient Egyptians saw death not as the end, but rather as a crucial 
                        transition into a different form of existence. They believed that a person’s 
                        identity was composed of multiple elements—most importantly the ka (life-force) 
                        and ba (personality), which after death could travel into the underworld realm 
                        known as the Duat. To reach a blessed afterlife, one needed not only the 
                        proper rituals (such as mummification and tomb-provisions) but also a moral life 
                        guided by the principle of Maat (truth, balance, order). 
                    </p>

                    <p>Upon death, the deceased embarked on a perilous journey through the Duat, encountering 
                        trials and obstacles. One of the most famous scenes is the “weighing of the heart,” where 
                        the heart of the deceased was weighed against the feather of Maat; if the heart was heavier 
                        with wrongdoing, the soul faced obliteration rather than eternal life. If successful, the 
                        soul would be transformed into an akh—a transfigured being—and enter the idyllic paradise 
                        of the Field of Reeds (also called Aaru), a mirror of one’s earthly life filled with fields, 
                        water, and plenty. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Rituals played a critical role in making this journey possible. Texts such as the Book of the 
                        Dead (and earlier the Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts) provided spells and guidance for the deceased
                        to navigate the afterlife. Meanwhile, the living had a duty: offering food, maintaining the tomb, 
                        and performing funerary rites to ensure the ka would be sustained and the ba would be free to 
                        travel.

                <div>
                    <p>Ancient Egypt experienced persistent tomb raiding from the earliest 
                        dynasties through the New Kingdom. Wealth buried with the dead — jewelry, 
                        funerary goods, food, and even entire sarcophagi — made tombs an obvious 
                        target for thieves; robbers ranged from local opportunists to skilled 
                        craftsmen and insiders who knew weak spots in rock and seals. Archaeological 
                        and textual evidence (including court records and restored seals) show that 
                        robbery was common enough that authorities sometimes investigated and punished 
                        thieves, while builders and priests used architectural sealing, reburials, 
                        and magical texts to deter theft.</p>

                    <p>Famous archaeological discoveries highlight this pattern: most royal burials 
                        were plundered in antiquity, which is why Tutankhamun’s roughly intact tomb 
                        was such an extraordinary find in 1922 — it had been protected by debris 
                        and later re-sealed, unlike many other royal tombs. Modern excavations 
                        continue to turn up tombs that were robbed in antiquity (sometimes leaving 
                        clues such as breaches, missing goods, or reused objects), and in several 
                        recent high-profile finds archaeologists explicitly report chambers that 
                        were found empty or disturbed by ancient robbers.</p>

                    <p>In the present day, looting and illicit antiquities trafficking remain serious 
                        problems for Egypt’s archaeological heritage. Political instability (notably after 2011) 
                        and economic pressures have driven spikes in “subsistence” digging and organised smuggling, 
                        with satellite imagery and field reports documenting thousands of looted pits at sites; 
                        trafficked items move through networks to national and international black markets. 
                        International efforts (from UNESCO, Egyptian authorities, and foreign law enforcement) 
                        have had some successes recovering objects and prosecuting smugglers, but demand in the 
                        global antiquities market and porous borders keep the problem alive.</p>
